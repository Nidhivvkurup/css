The purpose of assigning project work is to encourage students to explore topics beyond the textbook, develop independent research skills, and apply classroom knowledge in a practical and creative manner. Through these projects, students are expected to enhance their analytical thinking, presentation abilities, and understanding of real-world applications related to their subjects. This initiative also aims to foster a sense of responsibility, time management, and academic honesty.

All projects will be assessed based on various criteria including the accuracy and relevance of content, originality of work, clarity of presentation, and overall neatness. Timely submission is also a critical component of the evaluation. In some subjects, students may be asked to present their projects or participate in a brief oral viva to demonstrate their understanding of the topic. It is important that the work submitted reflects genuine effort and not material copied from other sources.Late submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances.

Please ensure your work is complete, properly formatted, and submitted to your class teacher before the deadline.

â€“ By Order,
School Administration</p>
